# ROADMAP

## App Description
A web app that allows users to check whether a song or artist is present in an inputted user's playlists.

## To Do
- Determine API calls for the retrieval of playlists
- From playlists, determine how to extract all songs
- From songs, determine artist
- Write code to make API calls, will have to trawl through all public playlists either way, but song vs. artist will be slightly different
